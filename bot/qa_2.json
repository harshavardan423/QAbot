            "patterns": [
                "A salt bath furnace is able to maintain a constant temperature because the salt bath acts as a heat storage medium. The high heat capacity of the salt bath allows it to absorb and release large amounts of heat without significant changes in temperature. Additionally, the bath can be stirred or agitated to ensure even heating and temperature distribution throughout the bath. This helps to prevent hot spots and temperature fluctuations, allowing for consistent and controlled heating."

                "Potti Sriramulu was an Indian freedom fighter and social reformer who played a significant role in the demand for a separate state of Andhra Pradesh. He was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and was deeply involved in the Indian independence movement. Sriramulu's fast unto death for the creation of Andhra state was a major event in the Indian independence movement, which led to the formation of Andhra Pradesh as a separate state on 1 October 1953. Sriramulu died on 15 December 1952, as a result of his fast, and his death was a major catalyst in the formation of Andhra Pradesh as a separate state."

                "Carbon enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, and leaves the atmosphere through processes such as photosynthesis in plants and the ocean's absorption of carbon dioxide. Through respiration and the combustion of organic matter, carbon is returned to the atmosphere. The carbon cycle plays a critical role in maintaining the Earth's climate."

                "Electricity is the flow of electrical energy through a material, known as a conductor. It is characterized by the presence of electric charge, which can be measured by a unit called the Coulomb. The amount of energy that flows through a conductor is determined by the voltage, measured in Volts, and the current, measured in Amperes. The resistance of a material determines the opposition to the flow of current, and this is measured in Ohms."

                "Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It is known for the wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit properties of both waves and particles. The uncertainty principle states that certain properties of a particle cannot be known simultaneously with perfect accuracy. In quantum mechanics, a system is described by a wave function, also known as a quantum state, which is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation."
